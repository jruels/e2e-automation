# Deploy multi-tier application
This lab shows you how to build, deploy and manage a simple, multi-tier web application using Kubernetes. 

We will be deploying the guestbook demo application which is made up of Redis leader, Redis follower, and guestbook frontend.  After successfully deploying we will update the application and then rollback to the previous version.

## Start up Redis Leader 
The guestbook application uses Redis to store its data. It writes data to a Redis leader instance and reads data from multiple Redis follower instances.

### Creating the Redis Leader Deployment 
The manifest file, included below, specifies a Deployment controller that runs a single replica Redis leader Pod.

Apply the Redis Leader deployment file 
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/redis-leader-deployment.yaml
```

Verify the Redis leader is running 
```
kubectl get pods
```
You should see something like: 
```
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-leader-585798d8ff-s9qmr   1/1       Running   0          44s
```

Now let's check the logs 
```
kubectl logs -f <POD NAME>
```

If everything looks good continue 

### Create the Redis Leader Service 
The guestbook applications needs to communicate to the Redis leader to write its data. You need to apply a Service to proxy the traffic to the Redis leader Pod. A Service defines a policy to access the Pods.

Apply the Service 
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/redis-leader-service.yaml
```

This manifest file creates a Service named redis-leader with a set of labels that match the labels previously defined, so the Service routes network traffic to the Redis leader Pod.

Confirm service is running 
```
kubectl get svc 
```

You should see running service 
```
NAME           TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
kubernetes     ClusterIP   10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP    34m
redis-leader   ClusterIP   10.107.62.78   <none>        6379/TCP   56s
```

## Start up the Redis Followers
Although the Redis leader is a single pod, you can make it highly available to meet traffic demands by adding replica Redis followers.

### Create Redis Follower Deployment 
Deployments scale based off of the configurations set in the manifest file. In this case, the Deployment object specifies two replicas.
If there are not any replicas running, this Deployment would start the two replicas on your container cluster. Conversely, if there are more than two replicas are running, it would scale down until two replicas are running.

Apply the Redis follower deployment 
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/redis-follower-deployment.yaml
```

Confirm it's running successfully. 
```
kubectl get pods
```

You should now see the following 
```
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-leader-585798d8ff-s9qmr   1/1       Running   0          6m
redis-follower-865486c9df-bf68k    1/1       Running   0          8s
redis-follower-865486c9df-btg6h    1/1       Running   0          8s
```

### Create Redis Follower service 
The guestbook application needs to communicate to Redis followers to read data. To make the Redis followers discoverable, you need to set up a Service. A Service provides transparent load balancing to a set of Pods.

Apply Redis Follower Service 
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/redis-follower-service.yaml
```

Confirm services are running 
```
kubectl get services
```

You should see: 
```
NAME           TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
kubernetes     ClusterIP   10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP    38m
redis-leader   ClusterIP   10.107.62.78   <none>        6379/TCP   5m
redis-follower    ClusterIP   10.98.54.128   <none>        6379/TCP   35s
```

## Setup and Expose the Guestbook Frontend 
The guestbook application has a web frontend serving the HTTP requests written in PHP. It is configured to connect to the `redis-leader` Service for write requests and the `redis-follower` service for Read requests.

## Create the Guestbook Frontend Deployment
Apply the YAML file using the `--record` flag.
NOTE: We are using the `--record` flag to keep a history of the deployment, which enables us to rollback.
```
kubectl apply --record -f manifests/frontend-deployment.yaml
```

Now letâ€™s verify they are running 
```
kubectl get pods -l app=guestbook -l tier=frontend
```

You should see something like this 
```
NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
frontend-67f65745c-jwhdw   1/1       Running   0          27s
frontend-67f65745c-lxpxj   1/1       Running   0          27s
frontend-67f65745c-tsq9k   1/1       Running   0          27s
```

### Create the Frontend Service
The `redis-follower` and `redis-leader` Services you applied are only accessible within the container cluster because the default type for a Service is `ClusterIP`. ClusterIP provides a single IP address for the set of Pods the Service is pointing to. This IP address is accessible only within the cluster.

If you want guests to be able to access your guestbook, you must configure the frontend Service to be externally visible, so a client can request the Service from outside the container cluster.

Apply the Frontend Service
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/frontend-service.yaml
```

Confirm the service is running 
```
kubectl get services
```

You should see something like this 
```
NAME           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                              PORT(S)        AGE
frontend       LoadBalancer   10.100.155.147   a4c5f12d7bc424d0c9b8bbf365075610-659694935.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com   80:30926/TCP   64s
kubernetes     ClusterIP      10.100.0.1       <none>                                                                   443/TCP        7m4s
redis-leader   ClusterIP      10.100.86.252    <none>                                                                   6379/TCP       2m49s
redis-follower    ClusterIP      10.100.176.7     <none>                                                                   6379/TCP       2m35s
```

### Viewing the Frontend Service 
To load the front end in a browser visit your 'External-IP'

In the example above we can see that `frontend` Service is running on port 80 so I would visit the following in a web browser 

`http://<EXTERNAL-IP>`

## Scale Web Frontend 
Scaling up or down is easy because your servers are defined as a Service that uses a Deployment controller.

Run the following command to scale up the number of frontend Pods:
```
kubectl scale deployment frontend --replicas=5
```

Now verify the Pods increased to specified number of replicas
```
kubectl get pods -l app=guestbook -l tier=frontend
```

To scale back down run 
```
kubectl scale deployment frontend --replicas=2
```

Now check to see if Pods are being destroyed 
```
kubectl get pods -l app=guestbook -l tier=frontend
```

## Update frontend deployment

Confirm the version of the image you are using
```
kubectl describe deployment frontend |grep Image
```

You should see `v5`
```
Image:      us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/gb-frontend:v5
```

## Update frontend resources
Now we are going to update our deployment resources to trigger a rollout. Let's increase the memory request:

```
vim manifests/frontend-deployment.yaml
```

Change the memory request from `100Mi` to `200Mi` so it looks like below:
```
..snip
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 200Mi
```

Now save the file and deploy the new version 
```
kubectl apply --record -f manifests/frontend-deployment.yaml
```

Run the following to see that the Pods are being updated
```
kubectl get pods -l tier=frontend
```

You should see some Pods being terminated and new Pods being created
```
NAME                            READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
frontend-56d4ff456b-jpdhk       0/1       ContainerCreating   0          0s
frontend-56d4ff456b-pv2m2       1/1       Running             0          9s
frontend-56d4ff456b-rbz5p       1/1       Running             0          19s
frontend-56f7975f44-fgxk8       1/1       Running             0          7m
frontend-56f7975f44-j76lw       1/1       Terminating         0          7m
redis-leader-6b464554c8-jdxhk   1/1       Running             0          11m
redis-follower-b58dc4644-crbfs     1/1       Running             0          10m
redis-follower-b58dc4644-htwkm     1/1       Running             0          10m
```

Great!  Now you can confirm it updated to `200Mi`
```
kubectl describe deployment frontend | grep -A 5 -B 5 memory
```

Now that you're successfully running with `200Mi`  update the YAML file back to `100Mi` and deploy it.  Do not forget to use `--record`

After the update has completed confirm it is running with `100Mi`
```
kubectl describe deployment frontend | grep -A 5 -B 5 memory
```

## Rollback deployment 
Now let's say that something went wrong during our update, and we need to rollback to a previous version of our application. 

As long as we used the `--record` option when deploying this is easy. 

Run the following to check the rollout history 
```
kubectl rollout history deployment frontend
```

```
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         kubectl apply --record=true --filename=manifests/frontend-deployment.yaml
2         kubectl apply --record=true --filename=manifests/frontend-deployment.yaml
3         kubectl apply --record=true --filename=manifests/frontend-deployment.yaml
```

To see the changes made for each revision we can run the following, replacing `--revision` with the one you want to know more about
```
kubectl rollout history deployment frontend --revision=2
```

Now to rollback to our previous revision we can run: 
```
kubectl rollout undo deployment frontend
```

If we needed to choose a version previous to our last we can specify it:
```
kubectl rollout undo deployment frontend --to-revision=1
```

What does the rollout history look like now? 
```
kubectl rollout history deployment frontend
```

Remember when you rolled back the previous version it changed the order of deployment revisions. 

## Cleanup
To clean up everything run 
```
kubectl delete deployment -l app=redis
kubectl delete service -l app=redis
kubectl delete deployment -l app=guestbook
kubectl delete service -l app=guestbook
```

Confirm everything was deleted 
```
kubectl get pods
```
